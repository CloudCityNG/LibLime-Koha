   Upgrade to new accounting system,
   populating fees, fee_transactions and payments tables.
   This script leaves data in the accountlines table for reference.

This script has the following parameters :
    -output             : path to log output
    -h | --help         : this message
    -v | --verbose      : be verbose.  Set to > 1 for debugging output.
    -b                  : single borrowernumber to update (entire db is done without this param)
    -from               : starting borrowernumber
    -limit              : only to this many patrons
    -die                : die on failures
    -clear              : clear the fees tables before going.  If you run this script twice without this flag, you'll get duplicate fines.
    -actionlogs         : table name of action_logs table, used to recover corrupted fines data
    -confirm            : actually do it.  For safety's sake, this arg is required.
    -w | -workers       : number of workers to use.
    -wlog               : log each borrowernumber to a worker log.  Useful with --die (or if it dies without it) to identify which borrower caused failure and where to restart.
